Phaser Starter
==============

This is a boilerplate for projects using the Phaser game engine. It's an NPM package which includes gulp tasks for transpilation and a local development server, as well as a basic game skeleton.

Installation and Usage
----------------------
Make sure you have a recent Node version installed.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run develop` to start a local development server.

Run `npm run build` to create a minified, browser-compatible file in the `dist` folder.
